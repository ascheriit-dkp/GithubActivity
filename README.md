### Github Activity 

Just a little script to create false activity on Github profile by genererating multiple commit at differents rates on a private repo. 
Is it useless ? Yes without a doubt. 
Apparently i had too much time to waste. 
Fiddlig around on github led me to find a repo that kinda did the same things so i recreated my own version of it. 

I will upload at some points an explanation on how to use it. 

Anyway have fun !
